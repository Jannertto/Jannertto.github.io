							<h2>Programing</h2>
							<h3>Unity while studying</h3>
							<p>
								As i suspected while working whit Unity alone. I would learn very vertical slice of Unity exactly what i needed to get what i was working on to work. This lead me to make rather primitive code even tho it was not doing mundane things.
								At the school i learned a lot of things related to coding and Unity development.
							</p>
							<h4>First project in school.</h4>
							<p>We had a group project where we would work towards a project and i was head of making enemy behaviour script. The script worked on multiple layered collision spheres and eatch layer player character entered chansed the behaviour the enemy did. first layer was follow thit longest delay to when it updates the player location. second did same whit shorter time etc. Until the player was at hit range when the enemy would attack the player. In this project we had problem whit collaboration. my co programer who was tasked whit making the combat system of the player did so prety late and had problems whit the enemy behaviour script but did not inform me of this so i could fix the problem. instead for what i hear they burned them selfs out whit trying to make it work. I asked one of my other project mates if i should make a combat system but they said no so i refrained from doing so.</p>
							<h4>Second project</h4>
							<p>On begining of second year I started working on first game in my own universe. Project Jannertto is top down shooter that has complex character customisation system, that lets player customice the players turn rate vision area and type and lot of other things.</p>
							<h4>Third project</h4>
							<p>I started new simpler project to use new things i learned in advanced game programing its called tower defence modular. The game would be rather simple tower defence game but you could upgrade the towers whit modules instead of the general premade updates. Do you want your tower to shoot faster, at multiple targets or have area of effect. Well plob a module on it and it can do that.</p>
							<h4>Fourth project</h4>
							<p>This project was Unreal project made as group work and i was not programer in this project. Even so i did learn some visual scripting on material side of things.</p>
							<h3>Beginnings of Unity programing</h3>
							<p>I started to work whit Unity towards my first game project that was suposed to be my first project, that was a coop tactical shooter but found out it was to large a project for one person and to be first project.</p>
							<h3>Beginning</h3>
							<p>I started my coding whit a coding class whit C#. On the course i learned basics of object-oriented programing and made a small program that random generated players stats for warfammer fantasy roleplaying game second edition game character. it was console ran and had multiple options for how to generate the character stats.</p>
